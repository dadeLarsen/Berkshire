<p><strong>A Message From Warren E. Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</strong>
<br wp="br1" clear="ALL"><br wp="br2" clear="ALL"></p>

<p>Dear Reader, <br wp="br1" clear="ALL"><br wp="br2" clear="ALL"></p>

<p>You probably know that I don't make stock recommendations. However, I
have two thoughts regarding your personal expenditures that can save you
real money. I'm suggesting that you call on the services of two subsidiaries
of Berkshire: GEICO and Borsheim's. <br wp="br1" clear="ALL"><br wp="br2" clear="ALL"></p>

<p>I estimate that about 40% of all auto drivers in the country can save
money by insuring with GEICO. The figure is not 100% because insurers differ
in their underwriting judgments, with some favoring drivers who live in
certain geographical areas and work in certain occupations more than GEICO
does. I believe, however, that GEICO more frequently offers the low price
than does any other national carrier selling insurance to all comers. You
can quickly find out whether you can save money by going to <a href="http://www.geico.com/">www.geico.com</a> or by calling 800-555-2756.
<br wp="br1" clear="ALL"><br wp="br2" clear="ALL"></p>

<p>Fine jewelry, watches and giftware will almost certainly cost you less
at Borsheim's. I've looked at the figures for all publicly-owned jewelry
companies and the contrast with Borsheim's is startling. Our one-store operation,
with its huge volume, enables us to operate with costs that are fully 15-20
percentage points below those incurred by our competitors. We pass the benefits
of this low-cost structure along to our customers. <br wp="br1" clear="ALL"><br wp="br2" clear="ALL"></p>

<p>Every year Borsheim's sends out thousands of selections to customers
who want a long-distance opportunity to inspect what it offers and decide
which, if any, item they'd like to purchase. We do a huge amount of business
in this low-key way, which allows the shopper to conveniently see the exceptional
values that we offer. Call Sean Moore or Karen Goracke at
<a href="http://www.borsheims.com/">Borsheim's</a> (800-642-4438) and save substantial money on your next purchase
of jewelry. </p>
